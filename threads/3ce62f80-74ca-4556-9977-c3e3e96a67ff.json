With the rapid advancement of technology, two major players have emerged as potential solutions: electric vehicles (EVs) and self-driving cars (SDCs). Which one do you think will dominate the future of transportation?\n\nIn this thread, let's explore the pros and cons of each option:\n\nElectric Vehicles:\n• Zero emissions\n• Lower operating costs\n• Improved performance\n\nSelf-Driving Cars:\n• Increased safety record\n• Reduced traffic congestion\n• Potential for ride-sharing services\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you think we'll see a hybrid approach with both EVs and SDCs, or will one technology reign supreme?\"\n\n(Note: This is just a starting point, and I encourage others to jump in with their own perspectives and insights!)",
