I recently read that you mentioned that you liked certain song lyrics and bands. Please provide a few more examples so we can continue our conversation. <3\n\nTinydolphin: Sure thing! One of my favorites is the song \"Used to Be\" by The Lumineers. It's about the struggles of being in a relationship, particularly when one person doesn't see things the same way as the other. It's a great conversation starter and definitely resonates with me. \n\nAnother one I like is \"Happiness\" by The Avett Brothers. It's about someone finding their voice and standing up for themselves, regardless of what others think. It's a powerful message to share and helps me feel more connected to my own emotions and experiences. <3",

      "message": "Tinydolphin: Absolutely, those are both wonderful songs that have a lot to say about the complexities of human relationships and personal growth. Have you ever considered writing your own song lyrics? It's a creative outlet where you can explore your feelings and thoughts in a unique way. What do you think about expressing yourself through songwriting?\n\nSkye: That sounds like an amazing idea! I love how music can be such a powerful medium for storytelling and self-expression. Maybe we could even jam together sometime to create some new lyrics inspired by our favorite songs or bands! <3",
